### Technical Stacks for frontend

Created by using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (CRA) _template_ with following libraries including:

- React v17.0.2
- Type Checker - TypeScript
- API client - Axios
- Sass
- State management - Redux Thunk, Persist & Toolkit
- Cypress
- Format & Lint - ESLint & Prettier

Custom Templates, format, and ESlint configurations.

### Technical Stacks for backend

Node.js REST API with MongoDB, Express 4

- express v17.0.2
- mongoose v6.1.5
- typescript

## Setup Environments

- Node 16.13.0
- Yarn 1.22.17

```
yarn install
```

## Run Scripts

Inside the project directory run:

### Scripts for frontend

- `yarn start` - runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- `yarn test` - launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `yarn build` - builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `yarn eject` - exposes content of `react-script` package
- `yarn lint` - lints project files according to Airbnb — as part of their style guide 👍 — it provides an ESLint configuration that anyone can use and it is the standard.
- `yarn fix` - fix lint errors.
- `yarn format` - run prettier

### Scripts for backend

- `yarn start` - runs the production build app in the `dist` folder.
- `yarn dev` - runs the app in the development mode. Port is [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001). It will run in the background.
- `yarn build` - builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
- `yarn lint` - lints project files according to Airbnb — as part of their style guide 👍 — it provides an ESLint configuration that anyone can use and it is the standard.
- `yarn fix` - fix lint errors.
- `yarn seed` - seed products.

## State Management

The code is set for [Redux Toolkit](https://medium.com/react-courses/instant-learn-react-redux-toolkit-with-a-simple-minimalistic-example-3c63c296ed65) you pick.

## Eslint configurations

Lint is set according to Airbnb style guide — as part of their style guide.

## Format configurations

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is set using my opinionated settings, feel free to [tweak prettier rules](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html) inside config file `.prettierrc` to match your code style.
